# EBC4257-Machine-Learning


Hey y'all!

If you are lucky enough to have stumbled upon this ReadMe, then you have come to the right place! You'll find all sorts of goodies and things ready for
you to start your dive into Machine Learning. DISCLAIMER: This repo is a part of a course I am taking in Machine Learning, and as such, is still very much
in the works.

I do not claim to write the best code, nor am the best organizationally. However, I do believe in the value of collaboration, so feel free to give any
comments or suggestions.

## Using this project

Please fork this and modify the values/seeds to see how things work. Pull requests are welcome but most likely denied.

Cheers and thanks for reading ðŸ’ž
