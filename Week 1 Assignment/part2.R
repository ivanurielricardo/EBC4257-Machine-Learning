# We use the Spam dataset from the kernlab library

# each value indicates the percentage of words that appear in the email

# spam <- spam %>% 
#   mutate(type = recode(type, 
#                     "spam" = "1", 
#                     "nonspam" = "0"))
# Convert the "type" column into a binary variable

# Now we can try making predictions on the tree

spam.confusion <- table(spam.yhat, spam.test$type)
spam.confusion

spam.confusion[2,2]/sum(spam.confusion[,2]) # sensitivity

# Sensitivity is 0.8324 and Specificity is 0.9591

# We can use cross validation to check the pruned trees

cv.spam <- cv.tree(tree.spam)

# Pruning the tree would yield no better results

# Lets assume that pruning the tree would yield better results and prune the tree to 9 leaves

# Unpruned Sensitivity was 0.8324 and unpruned Specificity was 0.9591
# Pruned Sensitivity is 0.8142 and pruned Specificity is 0.9467
# Both are lower than the unpruned tree
