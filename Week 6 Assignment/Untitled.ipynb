    "**Supervised Learning**: typically have a set of p features measured on n observations, ad a response Y also measured on those same n observations. Predict Y using features.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unsupervised Learning**: We have only a set of features. Not interested in prediction, but rather, discover interesting things about the measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Unsupervised learning is often performed as part of *exploratory data analysis*.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Principle Components**: When faced with a large set of correlated variables, principal components allows us to summarize this set with a smaller number of representative variables that collectively explain most of the variability in the original set.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to find a low-dimensional representation of the data that captures as much of the information as possible"
